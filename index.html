                <p class="instructions">Coup is a role based game where the goal is to eliminate the other players influence entirely.
                    This can be achieved by revealing both of the opponents cards through different means.
                    Each player starts with 1 coin and 2 roles. Each role is tied to a different ability, but players can 
                    use any ability as well as call bluffs on the opponents action. In the event that a bluff is called,
                    if the player who activated that ability does not have the associated role, they then lose a role.
                    In turn, if they do have the associated role, the player who called the bluff then loses a card.
                    In addition, coins can be gained through abilities and 10 coins can be used
                    to 'coup' another player which effectively removes one of their cards. The last one standing wins. 
                    Below find a legend of the roles and their associated abilities.
